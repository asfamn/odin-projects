    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A beef burger is a classic, flavorful sandwich made with a juicy ground beef patty, fresh toppings like lettuce, tomato, and onions, all sandwiched between a soft burger bun. It's a quick and satisfying meal perfect for lunch or dinner, and can be customized with cheese, ketchup, mustard, and pickles for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (e.g., cheddar)</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Patties:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef with salt and pepper. Mix gently until just combinedâ€”do not overwork the meat.</li>
                <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty that is slightly larger than the bun, as it will shrink while cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare (adjust time for desired doneness).</li>
                <li>If using cheese, add a slice of cheese to each patty in the last minute of cooking and cover the pan to melt the cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Buns:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>While the patties are cooking, cut the burger buns in half and toast them lightly on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Burger:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
                <li>Top with a cooked beef patty, then add a slice of tomato, onion rings (if using), and pickles.</li>
                <li>Spread ketchup and mustard on the top bun, then place it on top to complete the burger.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve the burgers immediately with fries or your favorite side dish.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
