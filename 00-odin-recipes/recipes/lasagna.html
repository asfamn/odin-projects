    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> In a large pan, cook the ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination) over medium heat until fully browned.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook Onion and Garlic:</strong> Add chopped onion and garlic to the pan with the meat. Sauté until the onion is translucent and fragrant.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Tomatoes:</strong> Stir in chopped tomatoes (or tomato sauce/paste if you prefer), and cook until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li><strong>Season the Sauce:</strong> Add spices and seasonings (such as salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes). You can also add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in salted water according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, an egg, and some seasonings (like salt, pepper, and herbs). Stir until smooth and well-combined. You can also add a portion of grated mozzarella cheese if desired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 3:</strong> Add a layer of the cheese mixture on top of the noodles.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 4:</strong> Add another layer of meat sauce over the cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese, sauce) until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Top with Cheese:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Finish by sprinkling a generous amount of mozzarella cheese on top of the final layer of meat sauce.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After that, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before cutting into it. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
